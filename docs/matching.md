How Pind identifies tables
==========================

Pind is supposed to work with an already set up system. That means it is able to read table info from HyperPin's
XML database and update the correct table when a new version is downloaded.

But how does Pind identify a table from HyperPin at VPF and vice versa? This is very important, otherwise users will
end up with the same table added multiple times to HyperPin or even worse, a table gets overwritten with the
wrong file.


A Unique ID
-----------

In order to make table matching accurate, a unique identifier is needed. Fortunately, we have a few options here.
Firstly, there is IPDB.org which promotes an IPDB number, and whose database is pretty complete when it comes to table
recreations.

For original tables however, IPDB will come up empty, so another identifier is needed. Turns out that at VPF, we
have file IDs as well. So for original tables, Pind will use VPF's file ID.

Now, since we have a vibrant modding community, tables tend to be available in multiple variations, such as an
additional night mod version. For this, Pind will track an additional "mod" field that distinguishes between
the classic and any potentially modded versions.


How to match?
-------------

As explained above, our identifier has three components: IPDB number, VPF file ID and mod type. The challenge now
is to accurately determine the IPDB number for:

	1. All VPF downloads
	2. Your HyperPin database

Point 1 is pretty much taken care of. Pind contains [a map](https://github.com/freezy/node-pind/blob/master/server/data/ipdb-vpf.json)
that links all VPF cabinet downloads to an IPDB number. This map has been manually verified, using visuals from both
VPF and IPDB to ensure that the correct match is made. You can have a look at how it works by opening the path `/ipdbvpf`
in Pind. For new entries that aren't yet in the mapping, the usual search fallback is applied, which is nearly as
accurate.

Point 2 is somewhat more difficult. Right now, Pind expects the standard HyperPin format `Table Name (Manufacturer Year)`
and will search accordingly on IPDB. Before searching, Pind tweaks the search query for optimal results. Additionaly,
Pind ships with a mapping file for common titles. The quality of the HyperPin matches can be checked by opening the path
`/ipdbhp` in Pind. The displayed list highlights differences between the HyperPin database and the data fetched from
IPDB. It also provides a way to correct wrong entries and write them into the mapping file.


Persistence
-----------

When Pind adds a new table to HyperPin, it knows with 100% accuracy where the file came from (i.e. its VPF file ID and
consequently its IPDB number). In order to not to lose that information next time a user re-initializes Pind, this
data is written to HyperPin's XML database, looking like this:

	<game name="T2_CE_Tipoto_1.06_FS" ipdb="2524" vpf="6105">
		<description>Terminator 2 - Judgement Day (Williams 1991)</description>
		<manufacturer>Williams</manufacturer>
		<year>1991</year>
		<type>SS</type>
		<enabled>yes</enabled>
	</game>

If available, this data is read when parsing and used before falling back to the search algorithm.


Battlefield Tested?
-------------------

Not really (yet). It works with a 880 table file that mainly contains recreations and it seems to work well on a few
other systems, but otherwise it still needs approval. Feedback is appreciated though.
